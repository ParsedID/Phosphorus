Phosphorus Screen Saver for Windows 

Weekend project to bring to life a Windows version of the Phosphor XScreenSaver.
Original XScreenSaver for Linux and Unix users by Jamie Zawinski can be found at http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/.

Feel free to modify the original source and leave a comment if you like my work.

Requirements:
Requires Windows XP or higher and .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.

Installation:
You can test, configure and install it from any location using the context menu. 
For permanent installation move Phosphorus.scr to the Windows\System32 folder for 32-bit OS or Windows\SysWOW64 for 64-bit OS.

*Included is a sample text file filled with paradoxes.
